# Image Processing

This is a Python library designed for efficient and easy image processing with
OpenGl shaders.\
It works with almost any type of images, including PIL images, pygame surfaces,
numpy ndarrays, and moderngl textures.\
The library provides many processing filters and effects based on moderngl
shaders. It allow you to create fully customized shaders programs written in
GLSL. With simplicity in mind, it lets you create processes that run multiple
shaders at the same time.

## Installation

To install image processing use `pip install .` or use `pip install -e .` for
development mode (no need to reinstall it with each modification of
`image-processing`)

## Filters List

Currently, the library has all of these pre-built shader effects :\
CRT , GAUSSIAN_BLUR , BLOOM , GRAYSCALE , BOX_BLUR , CONVOLUTION , NOISE_REMOVER
, RGBA , CARTOON , EMBOSS_WHITE , BUMP , MOTION_BLUR , RADIAL_BLUR , VIGNETTE ,
SEPIA , INVERSION , FISH_EYE , BARREL , ANTI_FISH_EYE , OUTLINES_WHITE , COMIC ,
SIMPLE_CARTOON , MONOCHROME_PALETTE , CGA_PALETTE , EGA_PALETTE , VGA_PALETTE

You can see the [shader effects here](./examples/README.md)

## Usage

- To process an image, you first need a shader object. You can create one with a
  pre-built filter or by providing custom glsl source code :

```python
import processing as ip

# Create a pre-built shader that inverts image colors by providing a shader type :
shader = ip.Shader(ip.INVERSION)

# Create a custom shader with glsl source code :
fragment_code = ip.readFile('path/to/fragment/shader.glsl') # or any string that contains glsl code
shader = ip.Shader(fragment=fragment_code)
```

You can also provide a vertex shader source code, but both fragment and vertex
shader are not necessary : if not specified, the default program will be used.

- You can modify the shader uniforms to customize it with the `.setUniforms()`
  method :

```python
shader.setUniforms(direction=(150, 0), kernel=(2, 2, 2, 2, -17, 2, 2, 2, 2), etc...)
```

<bold>Warning</bold> : Not all shaders have modifiable uniforms. Check the
shader uniforms first in the shader guide.

- Now you can run the shader on an image like that :

```python
image = ... # any type of supported images (PIL images, pygame surfaces, numpy ndarrays, moderngl textures)
processed_texture = shader.run(image) # return a ip.Texture object
```

In this case the image is automatically converted into an ip.Texture when passed
in the .run() method.

- You can create textures with :

```python
texture = ip.Texture(image_source)
texture.size # access the texture dimensions (width, height)
texture.tex # access the moderngl texture
```

Textures are very useful as they can be saved or converted into all the
supported images formats :

```python
pil_img = texture.toImage()
surface = texture.toSurface()
array = texture.toArray()
texture.save('file/path/with/image/name.extension')
```

- Finally, you can create process that can run multiple shaders at the same time
  :

```python
process = ip.Process(ip.MOTION_BLUR, ip.NOISE_REMOVER, ip.BOX_BLUR, ip.RGBA, etc...) # created with filters
# or create your own shaders first :
shader1 = ip.Shader(fragment='fragment code')
shader2 = ip.Shader(ip.GRAYSCALE)
process = ip.Process(shader1, shader2)
# you can also create one with different sources :
process = Process(ip.MOTION_BLUR, shader1)
# run the process :
output_tex = process.run(image_source)
```

You can modify a process with :

```python
process.remove(step_index) # remove a shader step
process.add(shader or const) # add a new shader step at the end of the process
process.insert(shader or const, index) # insert a new step at an index, like a list
process[index] # access a shader step with its index
```

## Requirements

To run, the library require Pillow, numpy, moderngl, and pygame. Install all of
these by running this line in a command shell :

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

All feedbacks are welcome.

## Credits

For the momment, most of the pre-built filters are modified versions of shaders
found on the internet from websites like ShaderToy. I plan to rewrite all of
these one day.
